    "# Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Tile Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to the initial, essential preprocessing steps required for the 1 arc-second resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tiles covering the Ohio Region study area - 104 in total. Given the computational intensity associated with processing numerous high-resolution raster tiles, a strategy leveraging Virtual Raster Tiles (VRTs) will be employed instead of physically merging the tiles into a single large raster dataset. This approach allows for efficient handling of the data volume by treating the collection of tiles as a single virtual dataset without creating a massive intermediate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing workflow in this notebook focuses on preparing the DEM data for subsequent watershed delineation, a process that is inherently agnostic to projection at this stage. Therefore, reprojection to a specific projected coordinate system like UTM will not be performed on the raw or preprocessed tiles. Instead, projection will be applied later to the delineated watershed boundaries and derived vector features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific steps undertaken in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Verification of Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** Ensuring that all individual 1 arc-second DEM tiles are consistently referenced to the NAD83 datum (EPSG:4269), which is the native CRS for this dataset.\n",
    "2.  **Filling Pits and Depressions:** Applying algorithms to identify and fill sinks and depressions within each individual DEM tile. Sinks (or pits) are local topographic lows surrounded by higher elevation values, where water flow would terminate in a standard flow direction calculation. Filling these depressions creates a hydrologically connected surface by raising the elevation of sink cells to the level of their lowest spill point. This step is critical for accurately determining continuous flow paths across the terrain, which is a necessary prerequisite for deriving flow direction and accumulation grids used in automated watershed delineation.\n",
    "3.  **Creation of Virtual Raster Tiles (VRTs):** Constructing VRT files that virtually mosaic the preprocessed (sink-filled) individual DEM tiles. These VRTs will serve as the input for subsequent terrain analysis steps, allowing seamless access to the data across tile boundaries without the need for physical mosaicking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this notebook will be a collection of sink-filled DEM tiles, organized into VRTs, ready for flow direction and accumulation calculations leading to watershed delineation."
