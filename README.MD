# ML ModClark IUH Parameter Estimation

## Problem Statement

Accurately estimating the parameters of the ModClark Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) is crucial for effective hydrological modeling, impacting vital applications such as flood forecasting, water resource management, dam safety, and predicting streamflow responses to future land cover changes. Traditional methods for determining these parameters often rely heavily on historical observed rainfall-runoff data within a specific basin. This dependency poses significant challenges, particularly in ungauged basins where such data is scarce or entirely unavailable. Furthermore, even in gauged basins, the calibration processes can be time-consuming, and may not always yield optimal parameter sets that generalize well to different future conditions.

This project addresses these limitations by leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a model capable of estimating the ModClark IUH parameters (time of concentration and storage coefficient) based on readily available physiographic characteristics and storm events of a watershed. By establishing the relationship between these basin characteristics and the IUH parameters, the developed model aims to provide a more objective, efficient, and potentially more accurate approach to parameter estimation, especially in data-scarce regions. This work has the potential to significantly enhance the applicability and reliability of hydrological models across a wider range of scenarios and locations, particularly within the [**DEFINE STUDY REGION**], the intended study region for application and validation with hydrology practitioners.

## Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) Concepts

The Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) is a fundamental concept in hydrology that represents the theoretical direct runoff hydrograph resulting from a unit volume (e.g., 1 mm or 1 inch) of effective rainfall applied instantaneously and uniformly over the entire drainage basin. It essentially characterizes the basin's response to a unit impulse of rainfal, and conceptually, it is unique for each watershed.

Key assumptions underlying the IUH concept include:

* **Instantaneous Rainfall:** The effective rainfall occurs over an infinitesimally short period.
* **Uniform Rainfall:** The effective rainfall is distributed uniformly across the entire watershed.
* **Linearity:** The direct runoff response is directly proportional to the effective rainfall amount. Doubling the rainfall will double the runoff at every point in time.
* **Time-Invariance:** The basin's response characteristics remain constant over time for different rainfall events.

The IUH serves as a building block for deriving the direct runoff hydrograph for any given effective rainfall hyetograph through convolution. **By knowing the IUH of a basin, we can predict its runoff response to more complex and realistic rainfall patterns.**

The **Modified Clark (ModClark)** is a specific type of synthetic IUH. It is a modification of traditional Clark's IUH in which it explicitly accounts for variations in travel time to the watershed outlet using a gridded representation of the watershed to route excess precipitation to the subbasin outlet. Its key parameters are:

* **Time Travel Index ($T_{t,cell}$):** Represents the time it takes for water to travel from in the watershed to the outlet. It given by the formula below:

$$T_{t,cell} = T_{c,watershed}\frac{D_{cell}}{D_{max}}$$ 
where $D_{cell}$ is the travel distance from a grid cell to the watershed outlet and $D_{max}$ is the travel distance for the grid cell that is most distant from the watershed outlet. $T_{c,watershed}$ is the Time of Concentration for the watershed. It represents the time it takes for water to travel from the hydraulically most distant point in the watershed to the outlet. It reflects the basin's size and slope characteristics.
* **Storage Coefficient ($R$):** Represents the temporary storage of water within the watershed as it travels towards the outlet. It reflects the influence of channel and floodplain storage. It assumes it is uniform throughout each grid cell.

Estimating these $T_{c,watershed}$ and $R$ parameters accurately is crucial for the ModClark model to effectively simulate the basin's runoff response. **This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict these parameters based on basin characteristics.**

## Project Goals

This project aims to significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of hydrological modeling, particularly for engineering companies and government authorities involved in water resource management and flood prediction. The primary goals are:

* **Estimation of ModClark Parameters**: To develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of estimating the ModClark Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) parameters directly from the geophysical characteristics of a watershed.

* **Development of a User-Friendly Web Application**: To create a simple-to-use web application that streamlines the process of hydrological analysis. This application will:
    * Enable users to delineate watershed boundaries by providing the outlet coordinates.

    * Automatically derive the necessary geophysical characteristics of the delineated watershed.

    * Employ the machine learning model to estimate the ModClark IUH parameters rapidly.

    * Provide functionality to simulate the watershed's flow response based on the estimated parameters and user-specified storm events.
